I'm student at University of Pardubice. I'm studying Communication and Microprocessor Technology, it is Bachelor's program. I don't live in Pardubice, I'm from small and nice village far far away from there but I will not tell you name of this village. :) But I can tell you that I'm from Czech Republic. \r\n\r\nLet me say something about my hobbies. I'm really interested in electronic, especially in digital circuits like microcomputers, micro-controllers and so on. I'm programming ARM micro-controllers with Cortex M Core, in the past I programmed AVR micro-controllers and few historical processors like Intel 8080. I'm also programming for normal computers, especially in Python. And in the past I was a bit interested in PHP. Now I'm playing with FPGA and spending a lot of time on my project called MARK-II. So I write a lot of code in VHDL. \r\n\r\n# Some of my projects\r\n* [MARK-II](https://vladism.github.io/MARK_II/) - simple SoC in VHDL\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\nIf you interested to contact me, you can use one of my emails:\r\n* v.mlejnecky (at) seznam.cz\r\n* st49545 (at) student.upce.cz\r\n\r\nI also have a blog where I'm sometimes writing something about my actual project. But that blog is in my native language, Czech language. Here is a [link](https://0xvladis.blogspot.cz/).",
