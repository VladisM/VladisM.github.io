        <p><strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Vladislav Mlejneck√Ω and this is my simple personal web page with short info about me! </p>

<p>So, my name you already know. I'm student at University of Pardubice. I'm studying Communication and Microprocessor Technology, it is Bachelor's program. I don't live in Pardubice, I'm from small and nice village far far away from there but I will not tell you name of this village. :) But I can tell you that I'm from Czech Republic. </p>

<p>Let me say something about my hobbies. I'm really interested in electronic, especially in digital circuits like microcomputers, micro-controllers and so on. I'm programming ARM micro-controllers with Cortex M Core, in the past I programmed AVR micro-controllers and few historical processors like Intel 8080. I'm also programming for normal computers, especially in Python. And in the past I was a bit interested in PHP. Now I'm playing with FPGA and spending a lot of time on my project called MARK-II. So I write a lot of code in VHDL. </p>
